This a Discord bot for getting and visualising market data of a mobile game named EVE ECHOES . Its a sandbox MMO game. This bot gets graph of prices of items in the market on the Discord.
So just say `!g item-name` and it gives you a graph which contains sales and buy prices of that item from last few days . Like:
```
!g pyroxers
```
Services used:

1) [Eve Echoes Market](https://eve-echoes-market.com/api): I have used api from this website to get the data of item from the market.

2) Fuzzy Wuzzy : Used this library to guess the correct item even if the input is little bit misspelled .

3) Matplotlib: Used this python library to Create the graph.

4) [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) : This is the open source library for Python to create discord bots.
